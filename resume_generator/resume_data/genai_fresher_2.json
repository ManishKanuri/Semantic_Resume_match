Here is a highly realistic and original resume for a fresher candidate in the field of GenAI:

```
{
  "name": "Ritwik Chatterjee",
  "email": "ritwikchatterjee@gmail.com",
  "phone": "+91-9876543210",
  "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritwikchatterjee/",
  "summary": "Highly motivated and detail-oriented GenAI enthusiast with a strong academic background in Natural Language Processing. Proficient in fine-tuning LLMs, prompt engineering, and leveraging vector databases for transformer-based models like GPT and LLaMA.",
  "experience": [
    {
      "title": "Research Intern",
      "company": "Cognitive AI Research Lab, IIT Delhi",
      "duration": "June - August 2022",
      "details": [
        "Assisted in fine-tuning a pre-trained language model using prompt engineering techniques, resulting in an improvement of 12% in task-specific performance.",
        "Collaborated with the research team to design and implement experiments for evaluating transformer-based models on various NLP tasks.",
        "Utilized vector databases (e.g., GloVe) to enhance the performance of GPT-3 on downstream tasks."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "education": {
    "degree": "Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science",
    "institution": "Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi",
    "year": "2022"
  },
  "skills": ["GenAI", "LLM fine-tuning", "Prompt engineering", "LangChain", "Vector databases", "Transformers (GPT, LLaMA)", "Python"],
  "certifications": []
}
```

Note: As this is a fresher candidate's resume, I've focused on highlighting their research experience and skills in GenAI. For mid-level or senior candidates, the experience section would typically include multiple job roles with more detailed bullet points.
