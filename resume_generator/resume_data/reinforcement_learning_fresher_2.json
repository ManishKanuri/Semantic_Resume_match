```

Note that I've used a fictional Indian name, Rahul Kumar, and fake contact information. The summary is written to highlight the candidate's academic background, research experience, and skills in reinforcement learning. The work experience section includes a single internship role with details on the project, tools used, outcomes achieved, and team collaboration. The education section lists the candidate's Master's degree from IIT Delhi. Finally, the skills and certifications sections highlight the candidate's proficiency in reinforcement learning tools and technologies.
